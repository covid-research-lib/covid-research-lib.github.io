############## Russia ##########
Russia negotiated agreements to supply the vaccine to countries including Brazil, Mexico and India.

In August the European Union reached an agreement for AstraZeneca to deliver 400 million doses if the trials yield positive results. 

All nine have already signed purchase agreements with governments around the world. 


The US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is the biggest spender so far, having distributed more than $10bn in funding for vaccine candidates, either via direct financing or through vaccine procurement agreements.


On a per-capita basis, the UK has built the largest and most diversified vaccine portfolio, according to data from Deutsche Bank, having pre-ordered more than five doses per citizen spread across six leading vaccine candidates. The UK is followed closely by the US, Canada and Japan.

In total, dealmaking by the US, UK, EU, Japan and other rich nations has meant wealthy countries representing just 13 per cent of the world’s population have bought more than half of the leading vaccine candidates’ promised doses, according to Oxfam, the charity.

########################### WHO ###########################
The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed thousands of lives worldwide and has dramatically affected our daily lifestyle. Many countries around the world have been working hard by collaborating and signing deals with pharmaceutical companies to get people back to their daily lives.

Aside from deals made by national governments with vaccine manufacturers, WHO has also initiated a plan to work in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers.

Despite global appeals from the WHO for countries to pursue multilateral deals that provide for the equitable distribution of doses, the trials have sparked a multi-billion-dollar flurry of vaccine deal-making by national governments. The global initiative, named COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.

172 economies are now engaged in discussions to potentially participate in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved. COVAX currently has the world’s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other mayor producers.

The COVAX Facility is vaccine-sharing alliance of more than 150 countries that is linked to the World Health Organization. It is trying to avert a scramble by individual countries to secure vaccines for their own populations, often by pre-buying doses directly from pharmaceutical companies.

The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification.

############################ US #############################
Despite CDC setting its sights on November COVID-19 vaccine deliveries; however, experts say that is unlikely given the time required to test and evaluate the vaccines for efficacy and safety, adding that a vaccine would not be widely available to the public in the late second quarter or third quarter 2021.

As the vaccines move forward, the U.S. FDA is planning for the vaccine advisory committee meeting on Oct. 22, which aims at discussing in general about the development authorization and licensure of COVID-19 vaccines. No specific application will be reviewed.

The Operation Warp Speed’s goal is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021. The following companies have partnered with the U.S. and have received funding to help speed up the production of safe and effective vaccines, including Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutical), Moderna, AstraZeneca–University of Oxford, Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline

Merck was only selected and included into the operation’s portfolio as one of the possible candidates for funding, and will receive funding only when robust pre-clinical or early stage vaccine data, the ability to enter large, late-stage trials in the summer or fall, and the ability to manufacture at scale, with more than 100 million doses ready by mid-2021.
Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, stated that the program was going to fund eight different coronavirus vaccines. These include vaccines made by 1. Moderna and 2. Pfizer, which already started advanced trials in volunteers; a vaccine from 3. AstraZeneca and University of Oxford in the UK that is in Phase 3 trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa and which is started US trials in August; and vaccines made by 4. Johnson & Johnson and 5. Novavax scheduled to begin Phase 3 trials in September 6. The Sanofi-GSK joint effort is the sixth to be named as part of the program. The final two unnamed candidates will receive funding once they meet requirements.

############################ UK #############################
The UK government has now secured access to vaccines that use three completely different approaches:

the U.K. has now secured access to six different candidates, across four different vaccine type, taking its potential stockpile to 340 million doses — one of the biggest in the world. That is enough for five doses per person.

“The government’s strategy to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates will ensure we have the best chance possible of finding one that works

100m doses of the Oxford vaccine made from a genetically engineered virus
30 million doses of the BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine, which injects part of the coronavirus' genetic code
60 million doses of the Valneva, which uses an inactive version of the coronavirus
60 million doses of Novavax’s vaccine and 30 million doses of J&J's vaccine

Novavax and Johnson & Johnson said they have agreed to provide tens of millions of doses of their experimental coronavirus vaccines to the U.K. for undisclosed sums, as countries move to secure supplies of the shots.

############################ CA #############################
The Canadian government has signed deals to secures access to millions of doses of vaccines for Canada,
Agreements were previously reached with major pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax.

In all, Canada has committed $1 billion to buy at least 154 million doses of vaccines from five different companies, and most of that money will not be refunded even if the vaccines never get approved.

Canada will contribute $440 million toward the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, known as COVAX.
Canada is joining both parts of the initiative: one which secures access to millions of doses of vaccines for Canada, and the other which has wealthier nations pooling their funds to help lower and middle-income countries secure doses as well.
Canada has chosen to participate in both parts of the COVAX program. The first is for any country to join to get access to vaccines, and the second is a fund for wealthy countries to help low-income countries participate.

The agreement with Johnson & Johnson is for up to 38 million doses
The agreement with Novavax, a Maryland-based biotech company, is for up to 76-million doses of its vaccine
Sanofi- 72 million doses
Anand wouldn't specify exactly how many doses Canada would purchase under the deals or how much money it would spend because the government is in negotiations with international and domestic firms about purchasing additional doses of other vaccine candidates.


######### EU ########
The European Union, seeking to catch up with other parts of the world for access to coronavirus treatments, agreed with AstraZeneca PLC to buy as many as 340 million doses of the U.K. drugmaker’s Covid-19 vaccine now in development.

Moderna Inc. said it plans to provide 80 million doses of its experimental coronavirus shot to the European Union following a string of supply deals between vaccine developers and governments.

The Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers and has concluded successful exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August.

Moderna: 80 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to purchase up to a further 80 million doses,
Sanofi-GSK: 300 million doses on behalf of all EU member States
J&J: 200 
CureVac: 225
AZ: 300 

1105 million/ 445= 2.~


###### Japan ########
Japan is on track to have 521 million doses of five different vaccines in 2021, compared with a population of 126 million. Recent deals include global arrangements with such drugmakers as Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca PLC , as well as local deals with the likes of Shionogi & Co

Japan has agreed to acquire 120 million doses of AstraZeneca’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine if it is successfully developed, the health minister said on Friday.
The agreement comes after Japan announced a deal last week to buy 120 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech.
Moderna and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare are in negotiations over a deal for 40 million doses

In August, Novavax granted Takeda a license to manufacture and commercialize its COVID vaccine in Japan. Based on assumptions from Novavax, Takeda estimated it would have the capacity to make 250 million doses of the NVX-Co2373 vaccine per year.
